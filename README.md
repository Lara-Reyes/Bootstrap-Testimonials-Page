# Testimonials Page
This project is a testimonial section built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It was created during my bootcamp as my first project using Bootstrap. The testimonial section showcases feedback and experiences from verified graduates of another bootcamp. Each testimonial includes a name, profile image, and a quote. The design is responsive and visually appealing, making use of Bootstrap's grid system.
